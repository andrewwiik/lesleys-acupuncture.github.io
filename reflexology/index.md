## Reflexology treatments in Greenwich and Bexley 

![foot massage](http://legacy.ybsitecenter.com/multi-images/uk/legacy/var/ad/7110/50640-chinese-herbal-medicine-greenwich-and-bexley-shooters-hill-acupuncture-clinic-foot-massage.jpg)

Reflexology is related to ancient Chinese and Egyptian forms of
feet-centred healing. It involves stimulating reflexes on the feet
(or hands) that reflect the entire body. This process encourages the
body's own healing system. Reflexology offers a relaxing, therapeutic
treatment that focuses on the whole person, not just their symptoms.

This therapy can bring relief to a wide range of conditions and is
suitable for all ages. It helps to reduce stress and tension, restore
energy levels, detoxify the body and harmonise mind, body and spirit.

If preferred, Hand Reflexology can be provided instead of a foot treatment.
