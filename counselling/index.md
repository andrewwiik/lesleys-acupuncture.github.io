## Counselling service in Greenwich and Bexley 

![therapy](http://legacy.ybsitecenter.com/multi-images/uk/legacy/var/ad/7110/50637-acupuncture-clinic-greenwich-and-bexley-shooters-hill-acupuncture-clinic-therapy.jpg)

Metaphysical counselling approaches the client's situation from a holistic
perspective. It is based on recognition that we are more than body, mind
and emotions. We are also spiritual beings. A consultation offers
traditional counselling, and may also be accompanied by a visualisation, a
spiritual treatment, and / or a meditation if this seems appropriate at
the time.

A deeper understanding of our own personal experience, as well as a
greater awareness of our higher self, raises the quality, clarity and
harmony in our lives.
