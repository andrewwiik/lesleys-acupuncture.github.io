We have experienced masseurs who can help manipulate your muscles and body
tissues to treat a wide range of symptoms. We now offer both Swedish
massage and Indian Head massages.

### Swedish massage:

* Swedish Massage is traditionally described as the manipulation of soft
tissue for therapeutic purposes. Swedish Massage as we know it today, was
developed in the early nineteenth century by Henreich Ling (1776-1839) - a
Swede. Ling developed a scientific system of massage and movements based
on physiology
* The movements used in Swedish massage affect the muscles, blood vessels,
lymphatics, nerves, some internal organs and of course the skin. It can
have both an invigorating and soothing effect and it is for this reason
that Swedish massage is often recommended for relaxation
* An initial Swedish massage treatment allows the therapist to assess your
needs. The therapist will then be able to tailor suit the full body
massage session, concentrating on specific areas according to each
client's needs

### Swedish massage can help:

### Indian head massage:

* Indian Head Massage was originally practised in ancient India, where it
was believed that it enhanced the health of hair and a healthy head of
hair symbolised general good health
* Indian Head Massage combines therapeutic massage and acupressure
techniques applied to the face, head, neck and shoulders. It is a safe and
effective form of massage used to alleviate stress and tension

shoulders and face, and improves joint mobility in shoulders and neck. It
helps headaches which are caused by tension or fatigue, reduces tiredness
