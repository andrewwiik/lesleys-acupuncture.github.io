At Shooters Hill Acupuncture Clinic we take the time and care necessary to
make sure our patients find a resolution to their physical and mental
complaints. Below you can see some of the positive feedback we have had
from our patients.

### Our patients say:

#### LOW ENERGY

**Jean**

> As an older woman I was told by my doctor that I was just getting
> old and I had to put up with feeling tired a lot of the time. I would
> fall asleep in the chair after lunch and my knees were getting quite
> stiff and I found going up and down stairs was becoming more difficult.
> My neck and shoulders had also become stiff and reversing in my car was
> becoming impossible. I tried acupuncture after a friend recommended
> Lesley, an experienced acupuncturist she had heard of. I was pleasantly
> surprised to find that after just a few treatments my aches and pains
> were feeling much more manageable and I had more energy to go out and do
> those things I had always loved. I will continue to have acupuncture
> every few months as I am convinced that it made all the difference after
> only four treatments.

#### BACK PROBLEMS

**Nick**

> I have always been very tall and had a lower back weakness. My job as a
> builder didn't help. I could put up with the constant ache but when the
> pains started to radiate down the leg I got worried. An MRI scan showed
> some disc deterioration and I was asked to see a physiotherapist. Whilst
> the exercises helped a little, the real difference was made when I
> consulted Lesley, an acupuncturist working in Greenwich and Bexleyheath.
> I was afraid it would be painful and took my wife along with me. It
> didn't hurt at all. In fact, I had the best nights sleep that evening
> that I'd had in years. My wife said just sitting in the room made her
> feel really relaxed. After a few treatments, the radiating pain
> disappeared and now I am left with hardly any pain at all. I understand
> better that I need to stretch and warm up before going to work and
> Lesley is seeing me every few months now.

#### INFERTILITY

**Mary**

> I came to Lesley because my husband and I had been trying for a baby
> for three years. We had tried all the usual things from taking vitamin
> supplements to meditation and relaxation. Nothing helped. Before we
> opted for infertility treatment we read in a magazine that acupuncture
> could be good for helping to get pregnant. At first I didn't feel it was
> doing anything, but I did feel much more relaxed and energetic. After a
> month, my menstrual cycle seemed easier and more regular and to our
> delight, after three months, I found myself pregnant. I went on to have
> a beautiful baby girl and would wholeheartedly recommend acupuncture
> which was such a supportive and holistic treatment to have.
