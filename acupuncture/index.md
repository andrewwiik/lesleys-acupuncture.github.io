### What does acupuncture feel like?

* Most people's experience of needles is of those used in injections and
blood tests. Acupuncture needles bear little resemblance to these. They
are much finer and solid rather than hollow. Needles are inserted either
for a second or two or sometimes left in place for up to twenty minutes

* During treatment, patients commonly experience a heaviness in the limbs
and a pleasant feeling of relaxation, and many people find that it can
also lead to increased energy levels and better sleep as well as an
enhanced sense of overall well being

* Some change is usually felt after a few treatments and normally you
are recommended to visit your Acupuncturist once a week or fortnightly
at first and later, once or twice a year
