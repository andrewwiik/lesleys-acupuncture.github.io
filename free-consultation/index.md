We will talk to you about what you would like to get from your acupuncture
treatment. We ask details of your past medical history and that of your
close family, your diet, digestive system, sleeping patterns and emotional
state. Once enough information has been gathered to determine the likely
causes of your problem, the acupuncturist will select the most appropriate
form of treatment. All acupuncture aims to support the whole body and your
particular constitution. We go through a diagnosis which includes:

a) Taking the pulse<br />
b) Looking at the tongue<br />
c) Palpating the abdomen for tender or distended areas<br />
d) Giving a short massage where appropriate<br />
