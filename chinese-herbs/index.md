Chinese herbs can be taken by all age groups. Traditionally they are made
up of teas or decoctions. The formulas that we use are of extremely high
quality and come in a ready prepared freeze-dried form with an average
dosage of 3 teaspoons a day taken with water.

Depending on the severity of the condition, the herbal formulas are often
taken for several months or, in some cases, over periods of years
intermittently.
